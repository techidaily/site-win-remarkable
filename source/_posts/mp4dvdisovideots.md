### 1\. Why can't I screen record Bigo Live?

Most of the time, this is because your device does not have enough capacity or you did not grant permission to the tool you used to record. Check the storage space on your device (phone or computer) to solve this problem. Check to see if you have allowed the screen recorder to record a video. If everything appears to be in order, but you still cannot begin recording, try restarting your device.
